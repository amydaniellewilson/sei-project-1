      - The computer chooses a sequence of four colours.
      - The objective of the game is to guess the exact positions of the colours in the computer’s sequence.
      <br>
      - After you select four colours for your guess, the computer will give you a hint on the right hand side of how close you are.
      <br>
      - If you have any of the colours correct and they are in the right place, you will get a number of red pegs to alert how many you have right.
      <br>
      - If you have any of the colours correct and they are not in the right place, you will get a number of white pegs to alert how many you have right.
      <br>
      - If the rest of the pegs will stay black for however many you have not guessed correctly.
      <br>

      <br>
      - You win the game when you manage to guess all the colours in the code  sequence and when they are all in the right position.
