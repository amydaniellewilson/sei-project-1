### The Game
Mastermind was originally the 1970's boardgame and now has many online versions to be played. It involves the computer picking a random selection of 4 colours in a certain sequence and hiding these at the top of the board. 

There are 8 colours to choose from and the player must guess the 4 colours used and what sequence they were used in.
