### The Game
Mastermind was originally the 1970's boardgame and now has many online versions to be played. It involves the computer picking a random selection of four colours in a certain sequence and hiding these at the top of the board. 

There are eight colours to choose from and the player must guess the four colours used and what sequence they were used in. The computer will never pick two of the same color in this version, so it will always be four different colors. 

### How My Game Works
1. The player presses play which triggers the starting theme from Pulp Fiction to play and generates four random colors at the top of the board. During play, these four colours are covered so the player cannot see. 
2. The player is to click each colour they think is correct. Everytime they click a colour, it will appear on the board in the relevant place.
